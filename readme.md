# Common Accord

This is a proposal on an implementation of common accord.

## principles

+ documents are managed as md files and follow the [markdown spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.24/)
+ accord is an super set of markdown which enables the following features
    + import of documents
    + injection of variables
+ accord works as an preprocessor of mark down. This will follow the same approach as typescript as superset of javascript
